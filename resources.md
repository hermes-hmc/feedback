## HERMES Concept Paper - 2022-01-25

We’ve published a [concept paper via ArXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09015),
informed by the participants of our [project kickoff workshop](kickoff) in
November 2021, that discusses the state of the art, and lays out our ideas for
automated workflows to publish to InvenioRDM and Dataverse.

We’d love to have your reviews and feedback on the concept paper via
[PubPeer](https://software-metadata.pub/concept-paper-community-reviews),
ideally until 13 February!
