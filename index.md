**HERMES** is an acronym for "**HE**lmholtz **R**ich **ME**tadata **S**oftware publications".

To satisfy the principles of [FAIR research software](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068),
software sustainability and software citation, research software must be formally
published. Publication repositories make this possible and provide published software
versions with unique and persistent identifiers. However, software publication
is still a tedious, mostly manual process and impedes promoting software to first
class research citizenship.

To streamline software publication, this project **develops automated workflows**
to publish research software with rich metadata. Our tooling utilizes
continuous integration solutions to retrieve, collate, and process existing
metadata in source repositories, and publish them on publication repositories,
including checks against existing metadata requirements. To accompany the
tooling and enable researchers to easily reuse it, the project also provides
comprehensive documentation and templates for widely used CI solutions.

Many, if not most, publication repositories cannot be labeled "research
software ready" today (2022). In addition to the deposition workflows, this
project cooperates with the upstream [InvenioRDM](https://invenio-software.org/products/rdm/)
and [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org) projects. We are working on the necessary bits to
**achieve full readiness** for these and put a nice badge on 'em.

While the project partners are members of the [Helmholtz Association](https://helmholtz.de),
it's by no means limited to it!

We have an open mindset and will release any outcomes as open material.
Software will be developed in the open and released with an open source license.
Any scholarly publications, documentation and training materials will be
provided open access.


## Feedback

This is an open repository to collect feedback on the HERMES project.

We see our project as part of a global and inter-disciplinary effort to improve the state of the art in research software engineering, maintenance and scholarly communications around research software. We therefore appreciate any feedback you may have on the HERMES project itself and any of its outputs.

**How to give feedback**

Either [create an issue](https://github.com/hermes-hmc/feedback/issues/new/choose) in our project repository or [send us an email](mailto:team@software-metadata.pub?subject=HERMES%20Reachout).
