HERMES is an acronym for "HElmholtz Rich MEtadata Software publications".

A project to develop automated workflows for publishing research software
together with rich metadata, to improve finding, understanding, reusing, sharing
and citing, and promoting software to first class research citizenship.

While the project partners are members of the Helmholtz Association, it's by no
means limited to it!

We have an open mindset and will release any outcomes as open material.
Software will be developed in the open and released with an open source license.
Any scholarly publications, documentation and training materials will be
provided open access.

We see our project as part of a global and inter-disciplinary effort to improve the state of the art in research software engineering, maintenance and scholarly communications around research software. We therefore appreciate any feedback you may have on the HERMES project itself and any of its outputs.
