HERMES is an acronym for "HElmholtz Rich MEtadata Software publications".

A project to develop automated workflows for publishing research software
together with rich metadata, to improve finding, understanding, reusing, sharing
and citing, and promoting software to first class research citizenship.

While the project partners are members of the Helmholtz Association, it's by no
means limited to it!

We have an open mindset and will release any outcomes as open material.
Software will be developed in the open and released with an open source license.
Any scholarly publications, documentation and training materials will be
provided open access.

### HERMES Concept Paper - 2022-01-25

We’ve now published a [concept paper via ArXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09015),
informed by the participants of our project kickoff workshop in November,
that discusses the state of the art, and lays out our ideas for automated
workflows to publish to InvenioRDM and Dataverse.

We’d love to have your reviews and feedback on the concept paper via
[PubPeer](https://software-metadata.pub/concept-paper-community-reviews),
ideally until 13 February!

### HERMES Kickoff Workshop - 2021-11-12

In November 2021, the [HERMES project ran a kickoff workshop](https://events.hifis.net/event/205/)
with partner projects, stakeholders and interested parties. The [event website](https://events.hifis.net/event/205/)
provides general information about the workshop as well as the slides and
recordings for the presentations given at the workshop:

1. **Daniel Garijo** (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid): *SOMEF: A Metadata Extraction Framework from Software Documentation*
2. **Carlos Martinez-Ortiz** (Netherlands eScience Center): *Research Software Directory: past - present - future*
3. **Ana Trisovic** (Harvard University): *The Dataverse Project - Supporting (research) code in dataset publications*
4. **Sara Gonzales** (Northwestern University): *Powering open science and collaboration with Invenio*
5. **Dorothea Iglezakis** (University of Stuttgart): *Handling Research Software: Projects in Stuttgart*
6. **Felix Bach** (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology): *Code management in openCARP & publication on RADAR4KIT*

## Giving feedback on the HERMES project

This is an open repository to collect feedback on the HERMES project.

We see our project as part of a global and inter-disciplinary effort to improve the state of the art in research software engineering, maintenance and scholarly communications around research software. We therefore appreciate any feedback you may have on the HERMES project itself and any of its outputs.

### How to give feedback

Please [create a new issue](https://github.com/hermes-hmc/feedback/issues/new/choose) in this repository.
